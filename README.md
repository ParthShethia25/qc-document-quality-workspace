# Document Quality Control Workspace (V1)

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Product Management & Product Analytics** solution for handling failed or suspicious business documents in an AI-powered document processing platform.

The work was created as part of a **Product Manager take-home assignment** and showcases PRD thinking, UX design, API contracts, metrics, rollout planning, and a functional prototype.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Our platform uses AI to process business documents such as invoices and orders.
While most documents are processed automatically, some fail due to missing fields, low extraction confidence, or downstream system errors.

Currently:
- Ops teams rely on logs or engineering support
- Customers lack visibility into failed documents
- Resolution times are slow and manual

---

## ✅ Solution: QC Workspace
A **Document Quality Control Workspace** that allows internal ops teams and customers to:
- View all problematic documents in one place
- Understand why a document failed
- Fix issues, add comments, and retry processing
- Track document states from failure to resolution

---

## 👥 Personas
- **Internal Ops User** – triages and fixes documents across multiple customers
- **Customer Admin** – resolves issues within their own organization

---

## 📐 Key Artifacts
- ✅ Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- ✅ UX flows and low-fidelity wireframes
- ✅ API & data contract design
- ✅ RBAC and audit requirements
- ✅ Metrics, dashboards, and telemetry plan
- ✅ UAT test cases
- ✅ Delivery & rollout plan
- ✅ Functional prototype built using **Retool**

---

## 🛠 Functional Prototype (Retool)
A working low-fidelity prototype demonstrating:
- QC inbox with filtering
- Document detail view
- Commenting
- Retry and resolve actions
- Role-based read-only vs editable states

📂 Location: /Retool_Prototype

---

## 📊 Metrics Tracked
- Document failure rate
- Time to resolve (MTTR)
- % resolved by customers
- Common error types

---

## 🚀 What This Project Demonstrates
- End-to-end product thinking
- Ability to translate vague problems into structured PRDs
- User and system level thinking
- Data-driven decision making
- Builder mindset via functional prototype

---

## 📌 Technologies & Tools
- Product Documentation (PRD, UAT, APIs)
- Wireframes (Low-fidelity)
- Retool (functional prototype)
- JSON (mock data)
- GitHub (project versioning)

---

## 📄 Notes
This is a **conceptual product design project** intended to demonstrate PM and analytical thinking.
The prototype uses mocked data and is not production-ready.
